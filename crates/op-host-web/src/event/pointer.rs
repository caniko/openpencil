//! Pure W3C `WheelEvent` → `jian_core::gesture::WheelEvent` mapping.
//!
//! Sign convention (spec §2.4 + §3.5): Jian's internal axis is
//! winit-positive-up (positive deltaY = scroll content up). Browser
//! W3C `WheelEvent.deltaY` is positive-down. The mapper flips the
//! sign on `delta_y` so widget code reads the Jian-internal
//! convention regardless of host.
//!
//! Pure: no host-clock reads here (would panic on
//! wasm32-unknown-unknown). The C2 listener reads the host clock
//! (`web_time::Instant` or any polyfill) and passes the millisecond
//! value in as `t_ms` — matching `jian_core::gesture::WheelEvent`'s own
//! `t_ms: u64` convention (shared with `PointerEvent`). This keeps the
//! mapper unit-testable on native and IT does NOT crash at runtime on
//! wasm32-unknown-unknown — the panic locus moves up to the listener
//! glue, where the polyfill lives.
//!
//! `PointerEvent` mapping (mouse position / button / kind / phase)
//! lives in C2 alongside the listener registration — Phase C1 covers
//! only the wheel mapper because that's the cross-axis-translation
//! piece that benefits from being a pure helper.
