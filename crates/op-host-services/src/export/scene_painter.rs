//! Shared-painter bridge for raster export + `debug_screenshot`.
//!
//! Historically `export.rs` carried its own skia `paint_node` mirror
//! which diverged from the live canvas renderer (image nodes painted
//! as plain rects, `clip_content` ignored, text painted with a default
//! typeface and no styled runs). This module retires the mirror:
//! raster painting routes through the SAME scene painter the editor
//! canvas uses ([`op_editor_ui::widgets::canvas_viewport_paint`]),
//! driven over the export's offscreen `skia_safe::Canvas` via
//! [`op_host_native::NativeFrameBackend`]. One painter, one set of
//! pixels — what an LLM agent sees in a screenshot is what the user
//! sees on the canvas.
//!
//! The caller's canvas matrix already carries the export scale and the
//! margin translation (`render_raster_bytes`), so the shared painter
//! runs at `zoom = 1` with a zero viewport origin — exactly the
//! editor-canvas math at zoom 1 with the pan baked into the matrix.
//!
//! Vector writers stay on their own paths: `export_svg.rs` is a
//! hand-rolled SVG serializer (divergence documented there), while
//! `export_pdf.rs` paints through this bridge too — skia's PDF canvas
//! is a `skia_safe::Canvas`, so it inherits the same parity.
