//! Step 4 native widget glue — the only file in shell-native allowed
//! to call into `op_editor_ui::widgets`. Mirrors the
//! shell-web `widget_host.rs` so the editor-UI composition is
//! cross-platform: same widget code, same paint output.
//!
//! Layout matches `apps/web/src/components/editor/editor-layout.tsx`
//! — TopBar / LayerPanel / Toolbar (vertical floating) / Canvas
//! (fills) / RightPanel (only with selection) / StatusBar (floating
//! bottom-right) / AIChatPlaceholder (floating bottom-center).
//!
//! ### Mobile (iOS / Android) — Step 1f path
//!
//! Spec §11 — shell-native is desktop-gated (`backend` /
//! `widget_host` modules cfg-gated to `macos | linux | windows`).
//! Mobile widget rendering lands in Step 1f via `context::EaglProvider`
//! / `context::AndroidEglProvider`. Per the 2026-05-10 directive
//! (Android and iOS need no IPC / local CLI — only a custom provider):
//! mobile rendering is a custom-provider plugin point on the
//! `GlContextProvider` trait, not a separate IPC / CLI pipeline.
//!
//! ### Module layout
//!
//! This file is the public spine. Implementation methods are split
//! across sibling submodules (per the 800-line-per-file ceiling):
//! - `NativeFrameBackend` (`RenderBackend` impl) — moved to `crate::backend`
//! - [`helpers`] — hex parsing + resize-bounds math + constants
//! - [`geometry`] — canvas region / cursor hint / picker rect helpers
//! - [`input`] — cursor-move / release / panel-resize input handlers
//! - [`scroll`] — wheel + trackpad-pan (zoom / canvas + diff scroll)
//! - [`press`] — `apply_press` + new-node spawn (largest method)
//! - [`git_press`] — Git-panel press dispatch
//! - [`paint`] — full editor-UI composition paint pass
