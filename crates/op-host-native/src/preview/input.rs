//! Input dispatch for [`super::PreviewSession`] — keyboard, focus,
//! and the pointer pipeline with its scene→runtime coordinate mapping.
//!
//! Split out of `preview/mod.rs` to honor the repo's 800-line-per-file
//! cap (same pattern as `app_mode.rs` / `scene_helpers.rs`: an inherent
//! `impl` block in a child module reaching the session's plain-private
//! fields, which Rust's default privacy already exposes to descendant
//! modules).
//!
//! ## Scene→runtime mapping + pointer capture
//!
//! The scene paints DESIGN-canvas geometry (authored rects for Figma
//! Preserve imports; the unpromoted flex solve otherwise), while the
//! runtime hit-tests its OWN layout (the promoted tree, always
//! flex-solved). The two can disagree per node, so a tap maps through
//! the pair of rects of the deepest painted node it hit. A pointer
//! gesture anchors that pair at `Down` and reuses it for every held
//! `Move` and the `Up` (pointer capture), so a drag never remaps
//! through a neighbour mid-gesture.
//!
//! ## Track C-3: input gate during a screen transition
//!
//! `dispatch_pointer_phase` / `dispatch_wheel` DISCARD their event
//! outright while `transition_active()` — see that method's doc
//! (`crate::preview::transition`) for why discard, not queue.
