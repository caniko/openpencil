//! APP MODE state + per-root layout solve for [`super::PreviewSession`].
//!
//! Split out of `preview/mod.rs` to keep it under the repo's
//! 800-line-per-file cap. Holds:
//! - [`AppMode`] — the routed multi-screen state a marked document
//!   enters (entry screen mounted + `ScreenRouter` installed).
//! - [`solve_roots`] — the per-root layout + scene↔runtime coordinate
//!   capture, extracted from `enter` so Task 9's screen-switch reconcile
//!   can re-solve the newly-mounted root(s) the same way.
//! - the [`super::PreviewSession`] app-mode query + mutation methods
//!   (`is_app_mode` / `current_screen_scene_rect` / `reconcile` +
//!   test-only accessors). Rust allows inherent `impl` blocks in a
//!   child module; the fields they read are scoped `pub(in
//!   crate::preview)` on the struct in `mod.rs` (a plain `pub(super)`
//!   would resolve to `pub(crate)` here and leak the preview-only
//!   `AppMode` type — the `private_interfaces` lint). `reconcile`
//!   additionally reads/writes several plain-private `PreviewSession`
//!   fields (`runtime` / `scene` / `warnings` / `binding_sites` /
//!   `root_frames` / `available`); those need no extra visibility
//!   annotation because Rust's default (unmarked) privacy is already
//!   visible to descendant modules, and `app_mode` is one.
