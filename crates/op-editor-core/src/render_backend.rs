//! Compatibility re-exports for the widget painter facade.
//!
//! The implementation moved to `jian-widgets` as part of the
//! cross-platform component-library extraction. Existing OP code keeps
//! importing this module during migration; new shared widget code should
//! import from `jian_widgets` directly.
