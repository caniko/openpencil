//! Editor-UI overlay + panel state for `EditorState`.
//!
//! This module ports the ~30 widget-layer UI fields that
//! `openpencil-shell-core::document::UiState` carries beyond the
//! editor-state subset already modelled by [`crate::ui_draft`]:
//!
//!   - menu / dropdown open flags + their hover targets
//!     (file menu, locale picker, shape picker, fill-type picker, …)
//!   - modal open flags (export dialog, figma import, agent settings)
//!   - the agent-settings modal struct (see [`crate::agent_settings`])
//!   - panel widths, theme mode, locale
//!   - layer / page hover + right-click context menu + page-rename
//!   - the property-panel tab + flex-layout + size toggles
//!   - export scale + format, recent files, pending file action
//!
//! ### Move STATE, not RENDER code
//!
//! Many of these types are *declared* under shell-core's `widgets/`
//! module — for example `ExportFormat` in `widgets/export_dialog.rs`.
//! They are data/state enums, not rendering code, so their type
//! definitions belong in the state layer. The widget *painting /
//! hit-test* code stays in shell-core untouched.
//!
//! All types here are plain data (enums + structs of primitives /
//! strings / ids), so `op-editor-core` stays wasm32-clean.
